# Command
`tail`

# Name
Tail - Outputs the last part of files.

# Synopsis
```
tail [OPTION]... [FILE]...
```

# Description
`tail` command in Linux is used to print the last N lines from the file(s) to the standard output. With more than one file, it precedes each set of output with a header giving the file name. With no FILE, or when FILE is -, it reads the standard input.

# Options
Most commonly used options:

- `-n, --lines=[-]K` : output the last K lines, instead of the last 10; or use -n +K to output starting with line K.
- `-f, --follow[={name|descriptor}]` : output appended data as the file grows.

Other options:

- `--pid=PID` : with -f, terminate after process ID, PID dies.
- `-q, --quiet, --silent` : never output headers giving file names.
- `-v, --verbose` : always output headers giving file names.
- `-z, --zero-terminated` : line delimiter is NUL, not newline.

# Cheat Sheet
| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `-n, --lines=[-]K` | Output the last K lines |
| `-f, --follow[={name|descriptor}]` | Output appended data as the file grows |
| `--pid=PID` | Terminate after process ID, PID dies (with -f) |
| `-q, --quiet, --silent` | Never output headers giving file names |
| `-v, --verbose` | Always output headers giving file names |
| `-z, --zero-terminated` | Line delimiter is NUL, not newline |

# Examples
Let's see some examples with the more complex options:

1. To follow the changes in a file:
   ```bash
   tail -f /var/log/syslog
   ```
2. To stop following a file when a process dies:
   ```bash
   tail --pid=1234 -f /var/log/syslog
   ```

# Tips & Tricks
- Use `tail -f` to monitor files that are growing, like logs. It's a common practice in debugging and monitoring.
- Combine `head` and `tail` to get specific lines from a file.
- `tail -n +K` will print lines starting from the Kth line instead of the last K lines.
